		      AddContact+ plugin for Miranda IM
		     -=================================-


Description
-----------
Provides the ability to add contacts manually (without searching for them).
Known supported protocols: AIM, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ, IRC, Jabber/JGMail, MSN,
MySpace, Tlen, Yahoo and probably several other, which I haven't tested.
On some networks, a contact can be added only when connected. If the network
protocol you are often using is still unsupported, let me know.

Please use the appropriate (ANSI/Unicode) version of the plugin for your
Miranda IM version.

Miranda IM 0.8 or later is required. If you are still running 0.6.x or 0.7.x,
you should download and use AddContact+ 0.9.5.0.

Latest development version, source code and older releases can be found here:

Installation
------------
Copy addcontactplus.dll to your Miranda IM plugins directory.
